                Hello! My name is Christina. I'm studying Computer 
                Science at UT Martin.  I like programming, watching 
                Netflix, and playing games.</p>
            <p>
                I accidentally fell in love with computer science when, as an
                English major, I took an introductory CSCI course as an elective. 
                I had so much fun that semester that I instantly changed my major. 
                I love how creative coding can be, and how rewarding it is to finally
                solve that problem you've been stuck on. It's like a never-ending 
                puzzle, and the horizons of the subject continue to expand every day! </p>

            <p>
                I really like watching Netflix to unwind after a long day. 
                My favorite shows are Black Mirror, Bojack Horseman, and Stranger
                Things. I also enjoy documentaries. I especially like documentaries
                about different cultures and ways of living. Of course, I also enjoy
                silly stuff like reality shows and cheesy horror and romance movies.
                My husband and I look forward to the onslaught of terrible Halloween and
                Christmas movies every year.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Without a doubt, I wouldn't be the person I am today without gaming.
                I love both video and tabletop games. I have fond memories of inching
                through Half-Life as a child, wracked with fear of what horror lurked around
                the next corner. I remember my first Level 100 Pokemon (Vaporeon), and the thrill
                of finally beating my brother in Smash. 
                Equally fond are my memories of tabletop games. My family was never big on 
                watching TV or going on trips together, but we all love playing board
                games. UNO was the big thing growing up. My grandma loved to sneak 6's instead
                of 9's and vice versa. Today, I collect board games and have a fairly nice
                collection. I also enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, and act as DM for an ongoing
                campaign.

                            He's hilarious, smart, and incredibly kind. 
                            He always knows how to make me laugh when I'm 
                            having a bad day, and constantly inspires me to try
                            my best at everything I do. He's currently studying for the LSAT
                            so he can realize his dream of being a public defender.</p>

                            She looks just like my brother, and acts like him too. She wants                                to climb and take things apart. Like him, she's curious about how 
                            things work.
